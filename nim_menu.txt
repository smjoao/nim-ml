NIM-ML is a basic Machine Learning program made in pyhton that plays 21 Nim.

In 21 Nim, the game starts with a line of 21 pieces, then two players take turns
removing up to three pieces from that line. The player who takes the last piece
loses the game.

The more you play with NIM-ML, the smarter it gets (in theory...).

Press Enter to play with NIM-ML...
