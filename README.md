# NIM-ML
NIM-ML is a basic machine learning script that plays 21 Nim. It will (in theory) get smarter every time it plays a game.

Every time it wins a game, NIM-ML will increase the chances of using the same moves it used in that game, every time it loses a game it will decrease those chances.

## 21 Nim
21 Nim is a very simple subtraction game. The game starts with a line of 21 pieces, then two players take turns removing up to three pieces from that line. The player who takes the last piece loses the game.

If you want to learn more about Nim variations and subtraction games, you can access [Nim's wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)

## Inspiration
Inspired by MENACE, a machine made to learn to play Tic-Tac-Toe, built by Donald Michie.
